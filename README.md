# Collaborative kitchen
Computer science FYP UNITEN. Built with Google Firebase.

>Collaborative kitchen is an application where people can plan a meet-up and cook together. There will be a host & guest. Every user can be a host or a guest. The host is the one who will create a food listing on the app. The guest can choose their host. Itâ€™s like Tinder but instead of netflix and chill you cook and chill ðŸ˜‰.
